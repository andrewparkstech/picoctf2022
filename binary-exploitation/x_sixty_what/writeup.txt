Similar to previous buffer overflow challenge, but 64bit. This introduces some differences. Same idea of overwriting the instruction pointer, but not only is it at a different offset, it's 6 bytes, although the address we needed was only 3 bytes. The same address didn't work on the remote service, as the challenge hinted to. We had to go one more, to bypass the endbr64 instruction at the start of the flag function.
