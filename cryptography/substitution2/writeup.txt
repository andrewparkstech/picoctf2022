Tried the python script from before with same key. No luck.
Put the message thru quipqiup and got all the text decoded but not the numbers. Manually substituted those and wrapped in the flag format:

original: H6W4B_4H41R515_15_73I10S5_8J1FN808
quipqiup output: n r m ny due bf
manual insert of letters: n6r4m_4n41y515_15_73d10u5_8e1bf808
